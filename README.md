# microntek_CarManager

To Control some hardware on MTC Android Head Units the CarManager Modul is needed.

This is the compiled version of CarManager to make it easier to use in Android Studio projects.

Included is also the source from which I compiled the library.

Radio is an example Android Studio project where the carManager.jar is used.
